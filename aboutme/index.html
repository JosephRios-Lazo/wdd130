     <p>Hi, I come from Queen Creek, Arizona. I'm the oldest sibling and have two brothers and two sisters. I'm currently studying Accounting. Reading is one of my favorite past-time activities. Soccer is my favorite sport. I don't play it anymore, but I still watch a game every once in a while.</p>
     <p>I'm looking forward to learning with all of you!</p>
