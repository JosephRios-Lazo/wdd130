      <p>
        This site aims to make people have fun while reading reviews. People will come to my site looking for reviews that aren't boring. The reviews are satirical in nature and the goal is for them to be funny enough for people to want to stick around on the site. This site will answer many questions that the visitors will have about products. Some questions that will be answered are. Is the product worth your money? Will you enjoy using the product? And does the product do as advertised? The visitors will be reading these reviews by clicking on the products they are curious about.      </p>

      <h3>Reviews</h3>
      <p>
        When visitors come to this website they will be expecting quality content that they find useful for their future purchases. In my reviews there will also be a small too long didn't read section for those who don't care if a review is boring or not. The TL;DR (too long didn't read) section will show the most important information in a bulleted format for those who are too busy and are just trying to find a quick answer. Visitors will come to this site instead of others because the reviews will be unique and interesting. I plan on fine tuning the satire used in the reviews in order to make the visitors laugh and keep wanting more. Each review will be designed with colors relating to the products and the main theme of the website. I plan on having a webpage with all of the reviews written n it and another webpage with all the products listed and then have links that attach to each review This will make the website a little more simple to maintain. In the future I want to try adding a comment section using a service like Disqus. This will allow users to comment their thoughts on the reviews and communicate with each other about the products. This will also help me receive feedback about the reviews and further refine them. I have different ideas for the satirical formats that should be entertaining to the audience. I plan on using references to pop-culture that my target audience will be familiar with. It is important to make sure that the reviews are not to niche otherwise it will become less relatable in turn shrinking my potential audience.

      </ul>
      <h3>Products</h3>
      <p>
        I will be using interesting titles that engage the visitors and make them want to read more. The users will only need to have access to the site and know how to navigate a basic website. I also want to attempt to implement a search or filter function to allow for users to have a much easier time finding specific products that they want to know more about. If I am able to I will be including the search/filter function on the product page of the website. I will include links to social medias such as Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and Discord. An important part of this website is to build a community of people who follow it and want to support it by reading it and participating in the comment section. I will be doing my best to ensure that the content flows and looks appealing visually. Another important aspect is I plan on trying to create a navigation bar that can be hidden. This will allow for a more optimal reading experience. Lastly this website will also have affiliate links for the products that are being reviewed. These affiliate links will direct to websites like amazon.com. These affiliate links will also help the website generate needed revenue to maintain and upkeep it.
